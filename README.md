# Control LED from your Android Application in real-time

In this project, we are trying to control LED from Android Application with the help of Firebase Realtime Database, ESP8266 WiFi Module & of course one Android Application.

I have written a complete article on [Medium](https://kumar-bhupendra21.medium.com/control-rgb-led-from-android-application-f6c8ee60946a) with the step-by-step guide.

Also, you can use this project as a starting point of any IoT based project.
